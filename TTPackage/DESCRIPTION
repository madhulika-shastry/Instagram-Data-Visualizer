Description: This GUI was designed to help adolescent participants download and visualize user data from Instagram. Right now, downloading data from the Instagram app is confusing and instructions are difficult to understand. This project makes the downloading process more transparent, accessible, and understandable for the adolescent user population. This software will serve those involved in research to inform their participants how to select into downloading their data and provide clear information as to what they are consenting to do. This project will allow users to make selections on what variables to include and exclude, which gives them more control over what they want researcher teams to have access to and what data they want visualized. Once data is downloaded and entered into the GUI, it will also run descriptive statistics (number of posts, likes, etc) on the data and provide visual outputs of the analyses. Specifically, this GUI can analyze likes, story likes, comments, and direct messages, or DMs.
